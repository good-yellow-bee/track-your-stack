## üîß Key Implementation Steps

### Investment Server Actions
```typescript
// lib/actions/investment.ts (add to existing)

export async function updateInvestment(id: string, data: UpdateInvestmentInput) {
  const user = await requireAuth()

  // Verify ownership through portfolio
  const investment = await prisma.investment.findUnique({
    where: { id },
    include: { portfolio: true },
  })

  if (!investment || investment.portfolio.userId !== user.id) {
    return { success: false, error: 'Unauthorized' }
  }

  // Recalculate average cost if quantity/price changed
  // Update investment record
  // Return updated investment
}

export async function deleteInvestment(id: string) {
  const user = await requireAuth()

  // Verify ownership
  // Delete investment (cascade deletes transactions)

  revalidatePath(`/portfolios/${portfolioId}`)
  return { success: true }
}

export async function refreshInvestmentPrice(id: string) {
  // Fetch fresh price from Alpha Vantage
  // Update investment.currentPrice and priceUpdatedAt
  // Return updated price
}
```

### Investment Table Component
```typescript
// components/investment/InvestmentTable.tsx

export default function InvestmentTable({ investments, portfolioId }) {
  return (
    <Table>
