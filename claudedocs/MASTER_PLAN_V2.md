# Track Your Stack - Master Plan V2

**Version**: 2.0
**Date**: 2025-10-12
**Status**: Comprehensive Roadmap with Security, Business Logic, Data Integrity & UX Improvements

---

## Executive Summary

Track Your Stack is an investment portfolio tracking application built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and Prisma. After completing the MVP implementation (F01-F08), a comprehensive analysis has identified **critical gaps** across four domains:

1. **Security** - 15 critical gaps requiring 22-25 days
2. **Business Logic** - 11 critical gaps requiring 33 days
3. **Data Integrity** - Database constraints and validation requiring 12 days
4. **User Experience** - 23 feature/UX improvements across 4 phases

**Current State**: Functional MVP with basic portfolio tracking
**Target State**: Production-ready platform with tax reporting, comprehensive security, and professional UX

**Total Estimated Effort**: **67-70 days** for critical improvements + **35 days** for UX enhancements = **~102-105 days** (~5 months)

**Recommended Approach**: Phased rollout with parallel tracks for security, business logic, and UX

## Deployment Strategy

### Staging Environment

**Purpose**: Pre-production testing and validation

**Setup**:
- Separate Vercel project
- Separate database (Neon or Supabase)
- Identical environment variables
- Alpha Vantage test API key
- Automated deployments from `develop` branch

**Usage**:
- All feature branches merge to `develop` → auto-deploy to staging
- QA testing on staging
- Beta users may access staging for early feedback
- Production deployment only after staging validation

---

### Production Deployment

**Blue-Green Deployment Strategy**:

1. **Pre-Deployment**:
   - [ ] Run all tests (unit, integration, E2E)
   - [ ] Performance benchmarks
   - [ ] Security scan
   - [ ] Database migration dry-run
   - [ ] Backup production database

2. **Deployment**:
   - [ ] Deploy to production (Vercel instant rollout)
   - [ ] Run database migrations
   - [ ] Smoke test critical paths
   - [ ] Monitor error rates (Sentry)
   - [ ] Monitor performance (Vercel Analytics)

3. **Post-Deployment**:
   - [ ] User acceptance testing
   - [ ] Monitor for 24 hours
   - [ ] Rollback plan ready
   - [ ] Announcement to users (if major release)

---

### Database Migration Strategy

**Safe Migration Process**:

```bash
# 1. Backup production database
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# 2. Test migration on staging
DATABASE_URL=$STAGING_URL pnpm prisma migrate deploy

# 3. Validate staging
pnpm test:integration

# 4. Apply to production (during low-traffic window)
DATABASE_URL=$PRODUCTION_URL pnpm prisma migrate deploy

# 5. Validate production
pnpm smoke-test
```

**Rollback Plan**:
- Keep previous version deployed in Vercel (instant rollback)
- Database rollback: restore from backup + manual SQL if needed
- Feature flags for gradual rollout of risky features

## Alternative: Reduced Scope MVP+

**If budget is constrained**, consider a reduced scope approach:

### MVP+ (3-Month Timeline, $350K Budget)

**Must-Have**:
- ✅ Critical security fixes (MFA, audit logging, GDPR)
- ✅ Tax lot tracking + basic tax reporting
- ✅ Dividend tracking
- ✅ Data integrity (constraints, validation, optimistic locking)
- ✅ UX quick wins (dashboard, mobile, CSV import)

**Defer to V2**:
- ❌ Corporate actions (manual workaround)
- ❌ Advanced reporting
- ❌ Notification system
- ❌ Portfolio comparison
- ❌ Watchlist

**Reduced Team**:
- 1 Tech Lead
- 2 Backend Engineers
- 1 Frontend Engineer
- 1 Full-Stack Engineer (part-time)

**Result**: Production-ready core product in 3 months, iterate based on user feedback
